[**[ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·] VersÃ£o em portuguÃªs: LEIAME.md**](LEIAME.md)

## TL;DR

**Web of Trust (WoT)** is a core component of the **Private Law Society (PLS)**, designed to create a decentralized and trustworthy reputation network among parties involved in private contracts and disputes. WoT allows participants to assess trust in other users based on past interactions and action history. By using cryptographic pseudonymous identities, WoT ensures that both arbitrators and participants have their reliability verified in a transparent and auditable manner.

Trust is built through subjective ratings that are recorded publicly, enabling other participants to decide who they want to enter into agreements with or choose as arbitrators. The Web of Trust is crucial for ensuring the integrity and impartiality of the dispute resolution process within PLS, ensuring that all parties involved in private contracts act in good faith and with commitment.
